# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

This project analyzes COVID-19 data for India using Python. It focuses on **data cleaning, summarization, and visualization** to provide insights into the spread of the virus across different states and over time. The project demonstrates my first major attempt at handling real-world data and creating interactive visualizations.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Handled missing values, corrected data formats, and prepared datasets for analysis.
- **State-wise Summaries:** Calculated total confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths per state.
- **Visualizations:** 
  - Bar charts and pie charts to compare state-wise statistics.
  - Scatter plots and interactive charts for trends over time.
- **Pivot Tables & Grouped Analysis:** Aggregated data for quick insights.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Used **cufflinks** with **Plotly** to create dynamic and interactive charts.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** | **numpy** | **matplotlib** | **seaborn** | **cufflinks**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook `covid_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run each cell step by step to see data cleaning, analysis, and visualization results.  
3. Modify or extend the analysis with your own datasets or questions.

## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with real-world data.
- Gained experience in creating interactive visualizations.
- Learned to summarize and present data professionally.
