# COVID-19 India Data Analysis & Insight Report

This project analyzes COVID-19 data for India to uncover trends in case growth, recovery patterns, and state-level impact. The objective was to clean real-world data and extract meaningful insights that could support public health awareness and data-driven understanding of the pandemic's progression.

---

##   Objective

To analyze the spread of COVID-19 across Indian states and identify:

- States with the highest confirmed case burden  
- Recovery and fatality rate trends over time  
- Growth patterns across different phases of the pandemic  
- Regional distribution differences  

---

##   Key Insights

- A small number of states contributed to a large percentage of total confirmed cases.
- Recovery rates improved progressively, reflecting healthcare response adaptation.
- Clear time-based waves were visible in cumulative and daily case trends.
- Fatality distribution varied significantly across states, suggesting differences in demographics and healthcare infrastructure.

##   Technical Approach

### 1️ Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Handled missing and inconsistent values  
- Standardized date formats  
- Validated cumulative totals  
- Structured dataset for time-series analysis  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- State-wise aggregation of confirmed, recovered, and death cases  
- Time-series analysis of daily and cumulative trends  
- Percentage distribution and grouped comparisons  

### 3️⃣ Data Visualization

- Bar charts for state comparisons  
- Pie charts for distribution analysis  
- Scatter plots for trend exploration  
- Interactive visualizations using Plotly & Cufflinks
